#  A Twitter Clone

### What we are building

A basic CRUD principle where we can create, read, update, and destroy *Tweeets*. On top of the *Tweeets*, I used Devise which makes creating an entire user role and authentication system easy.

Technical:

Ruby 2.6.3
Devise 
bundle
create db
migrate
run server.

Overview:

1. Create a twitter clone using Ruby on Rails with MongoDB/MySql as
database.
2. Users should be able to authenticate themselves to do a tweet.
3. All the post should be searchable publicly (without authentication)
4. Other Users should be able to comment or retweet the tweets.
5. Feel free to use any open source library (Ruby / Javascript).
